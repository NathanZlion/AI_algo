1- learn a bit about the mathplot.pyplot library
    -> graph plotting
    -> table creation and populating it.
2- coding
    -> Implement a graph, node, edge class
    -> Implement `BFS`, DFS, UCS, `Iterative Deepening`, `Bidirectional Search`, `Greedy`, and A* Search algorithms
    -> Experiment your code with the city graph from the image
    -> record your test.
    -> Read about node centrality concept.
    -> There are several centralities types:
        Compute the Degree, Closeness, Eigenvector, Katz, PageRank, and Betweenness centralities on the graph from Question 2.

3- Implement the mathplot.pyplot for all your experiments
    -> install anacoda
    -> create a new Jupyter notebook
    -> write python mathplotlib scripts to record your findings

4. Finally
    -> convert the ispnb file to a pdf with experiment results.
    -> a readme.txt with group names.
    -> 'Group-15' zip file with the pdf and code in it.
